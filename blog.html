        <p class="title">HOW TO VISUALIZE WHAT WE SEE AND CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE</p>
        <p>Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure or power, but a quest for meaning. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning; in work(doing something significant), in love(caring for another), and in courage during difficult times.Frankl also describes prisoners who died less from lack of food or medicine, than from lack of hope, lack of something to live for simply because they lack the meaning and purpose of life. His major concern was rather why anyone survived at all than why they died. Frankl kept himself alive by dreaming at one point of the lecture after the war about the psychological lessons to be learnt from the Auschwitz experience. Suffering is meaningless and we give it meaning by the way we respond to it. Forces beyond control can take away everything except your freedom to choose how to respond to it. We are never left with nothing as long as we have freedom to choose. Having a “why” enabled people to bear the “how”. This is a profoundly religious book, insisting that 
 Don’t aim at success — the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s suffernder to a person other than oneself…you have to let it happen by not caring about it…listen to what your conscience commands…and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then…in the long run — success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.

 
This is a profoundly religious book, insisting that life is meaningful, and we must learn to see it as such despite circumstances — and there is an ultimate purpose to life.    Don’t aim at success — the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s suffernder to a person other than oneself…you have to let it happen by not caring about it…listen to what your conscience commands…and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then…in the long run — success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.
man is a being who can get used to anything.The prisoner passed…to the second phase, of relative apathy, a kind of emotional death, making him insensible to beatings
It was not the physical pain that hurt most (applies to adults and children) but the mental agony caused by the injustice/unreasonableness/insult of beatings
Frankl warns: it may give momentary psychological relief, but visualizing things you want but can’t have (ie: food, when you’re starving in a concentration camp) isn’t without danger.
Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain (they were often of a delicate constitution), but the damage to their inner selves was less. They were able to retreat to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom.
For the first time, I saw the truth — that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire…the greatest secret of human poetry/thought/belief:
For the first time in my life I was able to understand the meaning of the words, “The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.”</p>

 <h3> YOUTH NAVIGATION </h3>
    
      <p> The one thing that surely must cut across all these levels is being overwhelmed with the constant influx of  information and misinformation both on and offline. You see, hear, read one thing and before you have a second to grasp it, you are flooded by a completely different set of information. I bet we are all also experiencing multiple stages of panic, paranoia, fear, uncertainty and disbelief or even denial! It is happening to us, all of us, and all of us together. But mostly it’s compounding the already uncertain future that young people face today! the most important and urgent step is to be rational, to exercise calm and reason in all situations. Now this can be particularly tough in countries with a lock down situation. This is when it is key to take heart in resilience as a community, and an opportunity to use social media as a tool for community therapy and communication with each other on a positive note of solidarity – as opposed to one of panic. To learn from social media solidarity over the climate crisis, where movements sparked worldwide to support the cause and show young peoples’ resilience.Follow simple and routine World Health Organization WHO guidelines: Properly wash your hands more often, avoid crowded spaces, avoid handshaking, if you are sick wear a mask and seek medical attention immediately.
Educate your families, friends and community: Spread community awareness online and offline. For example look at how the Scouts are raising community awareness around the world and how the Ndlovu Youth Choir in South Africa used music and dance to dismantle myths about Coronavirus. Unfortunately, fake news spreads so fast in times of uncertainty. So be responsible. Verify every news and information before sharing. Be a source of calm during this storm.
Volunteer: Find opportunities to volunteer in your community. If there are older people or immunocompromised people help them out. Help out vulnerable people in your community to pick up their groceries and medicine. Healthcare workers around the world are called to work in high demand and they might need your help looking after their children or looking after their parents while they attend to life-saving work in clinics and hospitals around the world. This example shows how young people in London, UK, are helping out the elderly.
Donate: Find a reliable charity to donate. The UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation for an example, just launched a Coronavirus response fund. You can also support other campaigns such as “Stand together to beat Coronavirus” by Global Citizen urging that the G20 countries contribute financially to strengthen efforts by the World Health Organization.
Even though lockdown restrictions are increasingly eased, the same cannot be said for the pressures facing youth mental health services. It is vulnerable young people, particularly those most at risk from what The National Youth Agency (NYA) labels the ‘toxic trio’ of addiction, mental health issues and domestic abuse, who will require the most substantial and pressing support during the pandemic. In an emergency situation, this support will need to be accessible within minutes, not weeks (or worse). Unfortunately, the 2007/8 global financial crisis has left state-provided mental health services severely under-funded and plagued by endless waiting lists. The recent addition of increased demand and rising worker illnesses have only exacerbated these issues.
Even more worrying is the scale of this challenge. Charities have identified over one million young people who will be "at risk at home" during lockdown, whilst a recent NYA report found that 84% of young people have reported "worse mental health problems following school closures or due to not being able to access mental health support".
The minutes will also matter for young people facing economic insecurity. Many do not have the luxury of waiting three weeks to secure their next paycheck, with a staggering 36% of 15-to-24-year olds across London regularly slipping into poverty after paying their housing costs. The corresponding figure for the whole of England is 26%. This is compounded by the fact that it is young people who are disproportionately affected by joblessness due to COVID-19. The Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on improving the standard of living for low- and middle-income families, have found that prior to the outbreak, almost 40% of 16-to-24-year olds worked in sectors that are now on lockdown. This rises to over 60% for those born after 2000.
Taking care of mental health while living in the new normal will be broadcast live via the Webex Platform on the Envoy on Youth’s YouTube Channel. The session will focus on young people’s experiences and feelings of fear, anxiety, anger, sadness and grief due to the impacts of COVID-19. It will also offer young people the chance to share their experiences and solutions, and reimagine what the future of mental health could look like for themselves and their peers. This guidance note is meant to assist humanitarian actors, youth-led organizations, and young people themselves across sectors, working at local, country, regional, and global levels in their response to the coronavirus pandemic. It proposes a series of actions that practitioners and young people can take to ensure that COVID-19 preparedness, response plans and actions, are youth-inclusive and youth-focused – with and for young people. Recommendations are structured around the five key actions of the Compact for Young People in Humanitarian Action: services, participation, capacity, resources, and data.As COVID-19 (coronavirus) continues to wreak havoc around the world experts predict that African countries could be hardest hit. But African youth are not sitting idly by waiting for the worst to come; throughout the continent, they are hard at work providing solutions to help reduce the spread of the virus, and address the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic,
It is encouraging to see young people across Africa leading the way in the fight against coronavirus, and stepping up to help their communities. They know the future depends on their actions.
Indeed, youth represent energy, creativity and innovation and should be beacons of hope that can support the community at all times especially in times of such crisis. Through individual acts and collective action, young people are reclaiming power in the face of this pandemic and the powerlessness it makes us all feel. Youth-led civil society and movements are acting on an unprecedented scale. Youth are mobilizing communities to protect themselves, and supporting governments and health workers together.

  <h2>INHERITED WESTERN CULTURES</h2>
         <P>
           After many years of political independence in most African nations, claims that Africa should depend on imported economic development models for it develop leaves much be desired. It appears for Zambia the imported economic models have brought misery and poverty for most citizens. The models have given advantage to the west at the expediency of developing countries in terms of impetus for economic growth in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In addition, globalization process is a major trend both now and in the future as it spans opportunities and risks in many countries. The debate has gained space in Zambia as we can see consumption patterns, life styles and culture evolving over time in the livelihoods of the people. Not surprisingly, therefore, the poorest countries are faced with great difficulties in upholding their cultural identities as their heritage has so far been undermined by the western cultural identity.
Although it could be disputed that western values are superior to non-western values because no culture is superior to another, it is a known fact that their creativity, disciplined political leadership and strong democratic institutions contributed significantly to their development. Therefore, no culture is superior to another culture development wise. What matters most is the ability of the people of any nation to transform their culture to trigger off development in order to meet their immediate and future needs. But that is not to say that the developing countries did not contribute to such development. It is evident that the rich natural resources of Zambia not only contributed, but also sustained, and have continued to sustain development in the industrialized countries.
What are advantages of western culture?
The whole world has been changed, redesigned, and destroyed to accommodate western culture.
Cultural groups and traditional lifestyles struggle in this new western world. Traditional tribal living has often been replaced by poverty living.
A once empowered noble youth, who lives for his people, by rules and traditions made by his people, now mops the floor of a shopping mall. He can afford a TV, and has ice cream with his family on Sunday after church, that's inspired by a man who doesn't look like him, use his language and has no idea of his customs, or perceptions of life.
Western culture offers comfortable living for the relitively tiny few. More than 60% will live on less than two dollars a day: if you are one of them, your voice should be what counts.
So you can buy things and go shopping. That's a little fun. You can wizz around the planet, interfering with other people and other places from the luxury of your bubble; wonderful?
But all the leisure and pleasure for a tiny minority, is going to cost the lives of animals, birds, fish, reptiles, trees and plants, rivers and oceans, green mountains and valleys that were once pristine and alive. All that's lost so you can wizz around in pods, have an iPod, stare at a flat rectangle, have too many clothes, slump fat on a big settee, show off to your relatives that your children are doing well, bring your family up on Skype on the other side of the world. All so you can drive your SUV to a cousin's village, being the centre of admiration for a short while !?
Western civilization has brought good things too. Its own form of the arts, like with other civilisations, medicine, if you have survived the invasions, central heating is great if you living in unsuitable climate, abundance of food you can eat simultaneously to the starving. A fridge and washing machine is great. Water out the tap. Western civilization has also brought forth a population explosion, and some places have the much needed sanitation of population concentration. What are the unique advantages of western civilization? I will have to look that up, but I'll get back to you if I think of anything.
I dont think western culture has positive points. Western culture is rooted in the following
Patriarchal supremacy
European supremacy
lookism
Heightism
Beautyism
Ableism
Eugenics
social darwinisim
Prejudice
discrimination
survival of the fittest
Colonialism
Imperialism
slavery
war
income inequality
Arrogance
Pride
Dehumanization
Superficiality
shallowness
Cuniing
Deceitfulness
Conformity
marginalization
sexism
media manipulationThis is western culture.
Dignity of the individual. You CAN stand aside from the group. It in theory ENCOURAGES individual differences. May not end up so in practice, but the west is the only place that even gives lip service to this.
The scientific method and modern medicine and hygiene saved many lives in the 18th-20th centuries. Maybe it was too successful for its own good lol.
At least gives lip service to freedom and oftentimes it actually is true, (freedom) though during the COVID-19 pandemic some of this emphasis on freedom can be… problematic.
One of the most positive points of Western culture is that it had access to science and technology before many other cultures. Western Europe and the US also had industrialization before most other countries. That’s a huge reason immigrants go to the US and Western Europe to study STEM.
Here are five:
Human dignity
Constitutional and Human rights
Relative peace and security
Consumer’s purchasing freedom
Workers choice in seeking out employment
